# A case study comparing the results of a copper open-pit mine scheduling considering two different approaches for spatial interpolation of comminution geometallurgical variables

Block model with interpolated specific energy: mb_int_ET.csv
Displays the AXB and BWI comminution index columns and the ETK total energy column that was interpolated.

Block model with interpolated comminution indices: mb_int_AXB.csv
Displays the columns of the comminution index AXB and BWI that were interpolated and the calculated total energy column EtABe.
